![Adapters](https://github.com/flummer/usb-c-uart-adapter/raw/main/IMAGES/DSC_0443.jpg "Adapters")

This is just a simpel adapter with USB-C and TTL level UART, plus a few extra IO's. The pinout is designed to fit the 2022 Supercon/2023 Hackaday Berlin badges, and if you want to use the power rails, you need to bridge the corresponsing solder jumpers, they are disconneected by standard and need to be disconnected if used with the badges, as these to pins are used for other things on the badge.
